       <h2>Why and How to learn Python Programming Language?
    </h2>
    <font size="4px">
    <p>Python is the programming language behind giant applications like YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more apps.</p>
    <p>But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it to your knowledge stack?</p>
    <p>Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant opportunities, amazing communities, and a successful and fulfilling software development career.</p>
    <p>Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software development language developed in 1991, yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd version of Python ( Python 3).</p>
    <p>Let’s look at the reasons for the language’s popularity and how you can learn Python in the most engaging and practical way.</p></font>
    <h2>Why was Python developed?</h2>
    <font size="4px">
        <p>Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and tedious languages he was working with. Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language. Fun! The name suggests that already. But to understand what made Python one of the most loved programming languages continue reading below.</p>

    </font>
    <h2>Features of Python Language</h2>
    <font size="4px">
        <p>Here are the 5 major reasons that make the Python language so popular with a fan base calling themselves “Pythonistas”.</p>
    </font>
    <blockquote>
        <h2>1. Python is beginner-friendly.</h2>
        <font size="4px">
            <p>Python features very closely with the English syntax and is super easy to read even by someone, not a coder. It uses fewer lines of code and simple rules with no semicolon at the end of every line or confusing brackets. </p>

                For example, here’s a simple code to print “Hello, world” implemented in C (right) and Python (left). Python needs just one line.
                
                <p>https://images.app.goo.gl/SyRir8S6tt9pkXJr6</p>
        </font>
        <h2>2. Python is Easy to Learn</h2>
        <font size="4px">
            <p>Python’s rules and syntax are very easy compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. Another thing that makes Python simple is that it is an interpreted language. Interpreted language means when you write a program in C or C++, you write the complete code and then check for errors in the compiler. But with Python, you can check if your code is error-free in every line and correct if it’s wrong.</p>
        </font>
        <h2>3. Python is highly versatile</h2>
        <font size="4px">
            <p>Python can be used for small projects, say making a calculator, and for big and complex tasks such as web development, data analytics, etc. This is possible due to the pre-written codes you can use directly and build upon. These pre-written codes are called Python libraries and frameworks.</p>

                Once you learn the basics of Python through self-study, a degree, or a course, you’ll be able to understand a huge amount of code developed by other programmers.
        </font>
        <h2>4. Python is super flexible</h2>
        <font size="4px">
            <p>Python offers flexibility with the platform it is used upon. You can easily run the Python code you wrote on Windows over Linux or macOS without making any changes. Another exciting feature of Python is that it can run along with other programming languages such as Java (Jython) or C Language (CPython).</p>
        </font>
        <h2>5. Free and Open-Source</h2>
        <font size="4px"><p>Python is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. It doesn’t cost anything to download Python or to include it in your application. It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. You can download Python from the official Python website.</p></font>
        <h1>Applications of Python Language</h1>
        <font size="4px"><p>With incredible versatility, Python has a wide range of applications. Some major fields where Python language is used are-</p>
        <blockquote>
            <li>Web development (Backend)</li>
        <li> Software development</li>
        <li> Data Analytics</li>
        <li> Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>  Mathematical Analysis</li>
        <li>  System Scripting and</li>
        <li>  Cyber Security</li>
        </blockquote></font>
        <h2>Why learn Python Language?</h2>
        <font size="4px">
            <p>With an ever-growing community of Python users and its versatility and wide applications, it has become the most popular programming language (leaving behind Java and C++). It has got abundant libraries, various frameworks, modules and file extensions.</p>
            Here are the top 3 reasons Python is a great place to start and take your coding journey to heights.
        </font>
        <h1>1. High demand for Python programmers</h1>
        <font size="4px"><p>Many companies, including MAANG (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), are hiring Python developers. It is one of the most lucrative job roles in the IT industry. </p>
        We can sense how self-driving cars, smart homes, robots, and humanoids are the future of technology. Python is the most used language in developing machine learning and AI programs. Python is only going to grow in the coming decade.</font>
        <h1>2. Growing communities across the globe.</h1>
        <font size="4px"><p>Thousands of supportive and robust online communities are growing that guide and motivate beginners in their journey with Python. They hold discussion forums, meetups, and seminars worldwide for their people to learn and contribute. </p>
        Being an active part of these communities assure great learning and unimaginable opportunities.</font>
        <h1>3. Fastest growing programming language</h1>
        <font size="4px"><p>Python has developers worldwide and is used in most projects developed in this fast-changing world. Due to its open-source feature, many enthusiasts keep updating the language, and this adaptability makes it an ever-growing programming language.</p></font><br><br>

        <blockquote><h1>Features of Java Explained</h1></blockquote>
    <pre><font size="4px">        The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among 
        other things, its portability, security, and scalability. Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems 
        is one of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows 
        automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for 
        multithreading and security features. In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to 
        learn and use. </pre>
        <pre>        Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the 
        software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs 
        and developers alike.</pre>
        <pre>        Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated 
        applications. There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks 
        streamline the development process while adding even more capability.</pre></font>
        <blockquote><h3>Advantages of using Java</h3></blockquote>
        <blockquote><font size="4px">The use of Java as a programming language has a number of benefits. Some of the main benefits are as follows:</font> <br><br>
            <li>Java is a straightforward programming language since it is simple to learn and comprehend.</li>
            <li>Java uses implicit pointers, making it a secure programming language.</li>
            <li>Java code does not need to be constantly compiled in order to execute on a variety of systems.</li>
            <li>Java has strong memory management, making it a robust programming language.</li>
            <font size="4px"><pre>The above are some of the advantages of using Java and building applications making it the most popular programming 
language after Python. </pre></font>
        </blockquote>
    <blockquote><h2>Features of Java</h2>
        A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below: <br><br>
    <li><b>Platform independence:</b> Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java code can run without any changes 
        on any platform that supports Java.</li><br>
    <li><b>Object-oriented language:</b> Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular, reusable 
        code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes.</li><br>
    <li><b>Automatic memory management:</b> Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers 
        of the need to manually handle memory allocation and deallocation.</li><br>
    <li><b>Security:</b> Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users from potential 
        security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</li><br>
    <li><b>Rich API:</b> The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide range of 
        practical tools for creating applications.</li><br>
    <li><b>Multi-threading support:</b> Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent 
        applications that can handle running several threads at once.</li><br>
    <li><b>High performance:</b> Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code execution while it is 
        running.</li><br>
    <li><b>Scalability:</b> Java’s modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale 
        programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand.</li><br>
    <li><b>Simplified syntax:</b> Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler for developers 
        to write and read code.</li></pre><br>
    
    <font size="4px">Because they enable writing, testing, and deploying software applications simpler, quicker, and more effectively, Java’s 
characteristics are crucial for software development. These capabilities enable developers to produce strong, safe, and high-
performing programmes that satisfy the requirements of contemporary software development.</font>

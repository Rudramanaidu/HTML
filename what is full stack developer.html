            <h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
            <font  size="4px"><p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others.</p>
                Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.
                <p>In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.</p>
                In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
                <p>The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer.</p>
                The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector.
